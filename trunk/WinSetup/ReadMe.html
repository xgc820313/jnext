<h3>Readme file for JNEXT 1.0.7</h3>
<p>
This setup has installed JNEXT for use on Windows with IE, Firefox, Safari, Navigator and Opera browsers. 
</p>
<h4>Quick Start</h4>
<p>
There are four examples included in the setup. After trying out the examples you can modify and enhance the sources in the html file
for a particular example to get a feeling for the ease of development with JNEXT.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To directly access SQLite3 database files from JavaScript, open the JS-SQLite3.html file. The setup installed a sample database file (world.db3) in the same folder as the HTML samples. Select the database and click the "Read Database" button. The content of the database tables will then be displayed within the Web browser page.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For another example, open the POP3Client.html file, enter the POP3 server and account details
and then click the 'Connect' button. A list of subjects of your email messages should appear on the browser window (This example demonstrates
the use of AsyncLineSocket class). 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
To start the FileReader example, open JS-FileReader.html and click the 'Read File' button. The contents of
your win.ini file will then be displayed on the browser window. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In order to try out JS-sockets.html you should first have either a Perl or a Python interpreter
 installed on your system since they are used to simulate a server that the JNEXT sample communicates with.
 You can download and install Python from <a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5.1/python-2.5.1.msi">here</a>
 and Perl from <a href=""http://www.activestate.com/store/freedownload.aspx">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Once you have Perl or Python installed, start either server.pl or server.py to run the test server on your system and next open the JS-sockets.html
in your browser. Click the 'Connect' and you should start seeing messages received from the Perl or Python server.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Site authorization</h4>
<p>
The set of URLs that are authorized to access JNEXT libraries for a specific browser is defined in a file named <font face="courier">auth.txt</font> which is located 
according to the installed browser locations as described at the bottom of this page.

The structure of auth.txt is as follows:<br><br>
<table>
<tr>
<td>url1</td><td>lib1[,lib2,...,libn]</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>url2</td><td>lib1[,lib2,...,libn]</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>.</td><td></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>.</td><td></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>.</td><td></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>urln</td><td>lib1[,lib2,...,libn]</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
where <font face="Courier New">url1,url2</font> etc. are a list of urls that are authorized to access JNEXT libraries on the browser and <font face="Courier New">lib1, lib2 ...</font> are the
specific JNEXT libraries that each specific url is allowed access to. Specifying '*' for a library enables that url to access all available JNEXT libraries that
are installed on the system.<br><br>
<b>Note that the installed auth.txt file enables any local file full access to JNEXT since the assumption is that you trust the files on your system. Change the settings in auth.txt if you wish to further limit access to 
JNEXT from your Web browser</b>
</p>
<p>
Note that a different copy of auth.txt is used for each browser type. This policy might be changed in the future so that only one file
will determine authorizations for all browser types. Below is a table that shows the location of the auth.txt file for
various browser types on Windows (location may vary if browser was installed in a location other than the defualt):<br><br>

<table>
	<tr bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
		<td>Browser type</td><td>Location of auth.txt</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>MS Internet Explorer</td><td>c:\Program Files\Optimistec\JNEXT\auth.txt</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Firefox</td><td>c:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\plugins\jnext\auth.txt</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Safari</td><td>c:\Program Files\Safari\Plugins\jnext\auth.txt</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Netscape Navigator</td><td>c:\Program Files\Netscape\Navigator 9\plugins\jnext\auth.txt</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Opera</td><td>c:\Program Files\Opera\programs\plugins\jnext\auth.txt</td>
	</tr>
</table>
